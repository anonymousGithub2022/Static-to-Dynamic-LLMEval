## 📌 What is This Survey About?

Data contamination has received increasing attention in the era of large language models (LLMs) due to their reliance on vast Internet-derived training corpora. To mitigate the risk of potential data contamination, LLM benchmarking has undergone a transformation from *static* to *dynamic* benchmarking. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing *static* to *dynamic* benchmarking methods aimed at reducing data contamination risks. We first examine methods that enhance *static* benchmarks and identify their inherent limitations. We then highlight a critical gap—the lack of standardized criteria for evaluating *dynamic* benchmarks. Based on this observation, we propose a series of optimal design principles for *dynamic* benchmarking and analyze the limitations of existing *dynamic* benchmarks. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent advancements in data contamination research, offering valuable insights and a clear guide for future research efforts.

## 🤔 What is data contamination?

Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time—stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets—it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination. Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.

## ❓ Why do we need this survey?
![img/image.jpg](img/image.jpg)

This survey is necessary to address the growing issue of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, which compromises the reliability of **static benchmarks** that rely on fixed, human-curated datasets. While methods like data encryption and post-hoc contamination detection attempt to mitigate this issue, they have inherent limitations. **Dynamic benchmarking** has emerged as a promising alternative, yet existing reviews focus primarily on post-hoc detection and lack a systematic analysis of dynamic methods. Moreover, no standardized criteria exist for evaluating these benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we comprehensively review contamination-free benchmarking strategies, assess their strengths and limitations, and propose evaluation criteria for dynamic benchmarks, offering insights to guide future research and standardization.
